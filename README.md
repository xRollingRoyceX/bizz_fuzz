My attempt, it works. 


was trying to see where I stand in my learning path, and how I solve problems.
I was pretty suprised myself when I did it right after I messed up first(just to try something newish(switch statments), 
I wrote it in my own words in code, in just a few moments... once I realized a swich statment was not the correct route (newish statment to me.
.. i dont like it to be honest..) of coding I figured this out really quickly. 

(Could not solve this problem in python....)
